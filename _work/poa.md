problem_statement: There is a need for a solid open source, self-hosted blockchain
  explorer so side chains and private chains can see/understand transaction histories
  and balances. This is still fairly technical for the blockchain unaware masses.
  Users want to manage their transaction details and feel secure in themâ€”everything
  from blocks, transactions, balances, and tokens transfers.
solution_statement: '"BlockScout is the first fully-featured, open-source block explorer
  available for use by any EVM chain. Users can easily verify transactions, balances,
  block confirmations, smart contracts and other records stored on chain. BlockScout
  is designed to be fast, efficient, customizable and transparent. Its open design
  allows for easy adaptability, providing an explorer built by and for the Ethereum
  blockchain community." via https://poa.network/blockscout'
