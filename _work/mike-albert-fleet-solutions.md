testimonial: One of the ideas they pushed was not being afraid to fail. We learned
  by working with Gaslight that every time we move fast and regroup, we learn something,
  because we’re getting real feedback. Not to mention, we'll get to ROI even faster.

problem_statement: 'Mike Albert had a growing gap in their customer experience that
  was only becoming more apparent. They recognized the need to fix it, but weren''t
  clear where to start, nor did they have the capacity internally to dedicate resources
  to figuring it out. '
solution_statement: |-
  <p>Mike Albert Fleet Solutions has a brand new mobile app that customers love. But perhaps more importantly, their customer experience is built on new and progressive technology and they’ve adopted company-wide internal processes and perspectives that will have long-reaching impacts. By partnering with Gaslight, Mike Albert has laid the foundation for ongoing innovation as they continue address every layer of their customer experience.</p>

  <p>Gaslight brought more than great software development to the table; they brought a new level of speed and agility. “They were aggressive in delivering more quickly to our clients than we were even comfortable,” says Brown.</p>

  <p>Part of Gaslight’s process also included new perspective: tech projects aren’t just developed, they’re created. That means a designer is fully integrated in the process—critical to customer experience. Without a designer on staff, Mike Albert’s project outcomes often produced effective and efficient tools but lacked a feeling of excitement and creativity. The new mobile app gave Mike Albert early insights about the power of visually managing a technical initiative.</p>
