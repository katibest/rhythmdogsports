problem_statement: OMEGA was looking to replace their existing CRM with one that their
  reps could use in the field, designed specifically for their Microsoft Surfaces.
  Their needs included managing their leads and calendar in the same tool as they
  used to generate quotes, proposals, and deliver signed deals—all without ever needing
  to switch between multiple tools.
solution_statement: The new CRM was built directly into the Proposal Calculator, a
  tool built during our first phase of work, for an all-in-one solution to increase
  efficiency. Representatives had everything they needed in order to quickly enter
  new leads into the system and work them through the sales pipeline, including a
  pipeline view to see where each lead is in the sales cycle, a calendar to manage
  and track the their interactions with every lead, and notifications/reports that
  flagged stale leads and activities so they—and their managers—could prevent them
  from going cold.
