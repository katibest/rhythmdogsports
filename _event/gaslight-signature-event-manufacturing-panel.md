event_short_description: Attention all manufacturers ... those who innovate, will
  win! Join us for a Gaslight signature event panel discussion where we'll provide
  actionable takeaways and worthwhile networking. Instead of just talking about pain
  points in manufacturing, we're asking industry leaders for multiple solutions to
  help improve your business. Walk away with a checklist of 10 areas to improve starting
  today. We've hand selected a panel that has a wide range of experiences and viewpoints,
  including AMEND, Atkins & Pearce, Lantek, GE and CKK Group Consulting. With this
  signature event, we aim to add value to the manufacturing industry by bridging the
  gap between industry challenges and technology solutions.
