event_short_description: Cincinnati Ruby Brigade was formed by local developers who
  desired a place to talk about Ruby specific topics and share code. It has since
  grown into a thriving community as vibrant and creative as the Ruby language itself.
  Today we meet on the third Tuesday of every month to discuss and hack on Ruby code
  and strive to keep to the principle of less slides more code.
