title: Apprenticeship
short_description: Helping you successfully integrate high potential contributors into your team is right up our alley. The Gaslight apprenticeship program includes one mentor (senior level developer) and four developer apprentices that work elbow to elbow for 6 months to a year. We take care of recruiting and management of apprentices and on-site mentorship with one goal - to help them integrate and learn alongside your current tech team.
