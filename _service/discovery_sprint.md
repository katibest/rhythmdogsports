short_description: So, you want to build custom software and think you’re ready to get started? Not so fast — all too often we meet people who say they want to start a project only to realize (a few minutes into the conversation) that they have a lot more questions than answers. That’s okay, we love questions! But starting a project before answering those key questions almost always leads to frustration and sadness; and nobody wants that.
