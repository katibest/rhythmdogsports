As the first-ever Marketing Co-op here at Gaslight, I’d like to share my experience with the company thus far in the form of a blog post, and as it turns out, I enjoy blogging so this shouldn’t be a problem.

My journey with Gaslight began in late July when I was invited to the office for an interview here in Blue Ash. (We’re [moving downtown soon,](http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2014/10/03/exclusive-fast-growing-blue-ash-business.html?page=2) which is pretty awesome and exciting stuff for all of us Gaslighters.) Anyways, [Chris Moore](https://teamgaslight.com/people/chris-moore) and [Michelle Taute](https://teamgaslight.com/people/michelle-taute) invited me in for an interview, and once I arrived, I instantly knew that this was the place I wanted to be for the next four months. I should note that I had a nice offer with a company down in Atlanta before coming in to the interview with Gaslight. It was urgent that the process went quickly because I had to tell the other company my decision within the next day or so. 

Upon arrival to HQ (that’s what I like to call it), the first thing I noticed was that this place had a nice coffee shop aroma to it, and if you don’t know what I am talking about, then just visit your local Starbucks and take a big waft of air to get a sense. Yet, this was just the beginning of the pleasant atmosphere that I have come to realize is everyday life for all of us here. 

During my interview, Chris and Michelle grilled me with questions, and I didn’t think I was going to make it through. Not really. They were as accommodating as they come and not to mention a couple of the kindest people I have met. That was just another step on the proverbial staircase that led to my decision about wanting to work here. At this point, I was just trying to impress them any way I could, and I guess it worked?! Later that same day, Chris gave me a call to formally offer me the position. I was ecstatic. Not only did I not have to leave the city I enjoy so dearly and miss ALL the University of Cincinnati football games, but I wasn’t going to have to pay two different rent payments!

So fast forward a little bit, and it was suddenly my first day here at Gaslight. I felt like part of the team almost immediately, no exaggeration. From the culmination of the meetings with my bosses, the daily stand-ups and of course all of the welcoming people, I felt like I had been working here for a long time after just a week. 

When it comes to the work I’m doing, I feel as though it is meaningful to the company as a whole. Some of the bigger projects include a content audit of our blog and an ongoing sales history project. For the latter, I’m interviewing and talking with high-level executives to learn why they made the decision to hire Gaslight and identify trends in their language and business context. The takeaway from this project: It’s supposed to help better foster our marketing message as well as help us learn more about our target audience. 

Anyways, that is enough about the work. I forgot to mention that after only three weeks of working here they took me on an awesome adventure to Hocking Hills in Ohio for our annual [company retreat!](https://teamgaslight.com/blog/from-skeptic-to-convert-an-inside-look-at-the-2014-gaslight-retreat) I never knew the older folk could drink so much bourbon then turn around and be extremely productive the next morning. Jokes aside, that was an excellent experience and I learned more about the people of this awesome company than I ever thought I would. To add to that, the company as a whole seemed to take a huge step forward afterwards, and I believe it will start showing very soon. 

Overall, Gaslight is a company that thrives on building the best relationships with clients and taking care of its people. I couldn’t have imagined it being this awesome, and I am so happy that Michelle and Chris gave me the opportunity to work and learn in such a fun environment. I mean we literally have never-ending pretzel nuggs filled with peanut butter. What more could you want?

I’ll definitely be writing another post at the end of this co-op semester to further explain my amazement, but for now you can check out any of our other posts right [here!](https://teamgaslight.com/blog/)
