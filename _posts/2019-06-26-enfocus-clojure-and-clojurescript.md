I'm intrigued by Clojure and ClojureScript, but I'm having a hard time wrapping
my head around the concepts. I don't have a computer science background. I developed
a programming habit for professional purposes -- I wanted to get things done and
not wait for IT help.

I've been reading about Lisp lately. [Carin][carin] has long been the Cincinnati
evangelist, so I'm familiar with the vocabulary. She's always flying robots and
vacuums around in her Emacs REPL.

[I haven't yet reached enlightenment, it seems][defmacro]. I'm having a hard time
figuring out where these patterns fit in to my workflow today, but maybe I'm
asking a screwdriver to hammer nails.

### ClojureScript

Earlier this week, [Creighton][creighton] came to the office for the CinciJS
Meetup group and presented a framework he's been working on for the past couple
of years. It's called [Enfocus][enfocus] and it's goal is to keep teams moving.

I am interested in the ideas presented here, but I'm not yet sure why. I think
there are several areas I find appealing:

* Static Templates
* Same Language (Clojure on the backend, ClojureScript on the frontend)
* Functional Programming

It's still early for me, but I'm going to keep playing with these concepts
and ideas.
