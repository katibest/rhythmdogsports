### Can we Do Better Than Estimating?
Track 1 • 11:10AM
Software development has a long history of relying on estimates; but are they required? A growing number in our field 
are calling for “No Estimates!”. Is this really feasible? This talk examines the nature of estimates and how they are used. It will equip you to make informed decisions about when estimates are needed and what alternatives exist to help you 
be successful.

### The Holy Grail: Getting Customers to Write Acceptance Tests
Track 4 • 3:30PM
For as long as I've been testing code, we've talked about getting the customer to write the tests. Cucumber is the latest contender vying for this lofty goal. I largely passed on Cucumber as an additional step adding a needless layer of 
complexity between the tests and code. That's true as long as the customers aren't reading or writing the tests. By 
writing the specs at the appropriate level of detail, customers can actually engage in the process. The result is profound conversations with your customer about how the system actually works and how iit should work. In this session, we'll 
walk through the feature development process and show how we get our customers involved.

### Creating a More Efficient Designer/Developer Relationship
Track 1 • 12:20PM
How many designers and developers have a true back and forth relationship? We need a change in how we work 
together. Our past way of separating design and development is standing in the way. We will examine how to integrate 
design into your development project and deliver a better end product. Forget the "waterfall", we’ll be riding the boat 
together.

### Agile SOA in the Browser
Track 4 • 12:20PM
Lots of good men and women have given their blood, sweat tears to the SOA cause. The end result has not always been 
awesome. Too many times we've ended up with apps that are much more complex to build and maintain and API 
services that are still not quite right. Newer technologies like CORS and OAuth let us build apps which consume services 
in a new way. Companies like Groupon are leveraging this architecture today. Come and see what it's all about as we 
dive into the new architecture of web application development and how it lets us do SOA better.
