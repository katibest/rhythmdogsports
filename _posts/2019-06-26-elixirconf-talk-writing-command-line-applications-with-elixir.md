I was introduced to Elixir at a local functional programmers’ group [cincyfp](http://cincyfp.wordpress.com/). The syntax drew me in, and I ended up staying for it's semantics and functional nature. I’ve been having a ton of fun programming in Elixir. It’s really helped me to think about my programs differently and break up problems into smaller processes using pipelines and pattern matching.

In my talk at the first-ever [ElixirConf](http://elixirconf.com/), I wanted to show that Elixir goes beyond being a great language for building applications that are massively concurrent, distributed and highly available. The expressiveness of Elixir also makes it a good choice to write applications of any size, even small command-line applications.
