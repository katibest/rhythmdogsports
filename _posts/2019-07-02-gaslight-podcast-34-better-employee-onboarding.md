Gaslight COO [Dewayne Greenwood](https://teamgaslight.com/people/dewayne-greenwood) and I chatted about how he took our employee onboarding from a zero to a 10. We talked about:

* Our employee onboarding failures
* How we turned it around
* What we learned from improv
* A typical first day at Gaslight
* A typical second day at Gaslight
* Reinforcing core values
* And more!
