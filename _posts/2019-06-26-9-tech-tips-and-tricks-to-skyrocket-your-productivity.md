You don’t have to be a computer geek to boost your productivity with technology. But it helps if you're friends with a few to give you the inside scoop.

Here are just a few of the tools we use around the office to make life a little easier:

### 1. Manage Distractions With RescueTime
Not sure where all your time went when the end of the day rolls around? [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/) tracks exactly how you spend your computer minutes each day—whether it’s browsing Facebook or staring at Excel spreadsheets. Then you can use the data to improve your productivity.

### 2. Outsource Tedious Tasks With If This, Then That
Think of [If This, Then That](https://ifttt.com/) as a digital personal assistant that automates small tasks you’d like to accomplish online. You set up tasks on the site: If I post a photo to Instagram, then save it to my Dropbox. Or: If a standing desk goes up for sale on Craigslist, then send me an email. Then sit back and enjoy your extra free time.

### 3. Stop Junk Email with Unenroll.Me
Newsletters and junk clogging up your inbox? With one click, [Unenroll.Me](https://unroll.me/) generates a list of all your email subscriptions. Then unsubscribe to junk with one click as you go down the list. Receive the newsletters you still love as a daily digest.

### 4. Never Forget a Password Again with LastPass
Add all your passwords to this secure online password manager. Then let [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/) login to your favorite sites for you, so you don’t have to waste time racking your brain for forgotten passwords. Or worse yet, going through the hassle of resetting them.

### 5. Set Priorities and Track Projects With Trello
This free online project management software makes it easy to collaborate with office mates or colleagues around the world. You create different [Trello](https://trello.com/) boards for each project and cards for individual tasks or ideas that you can move through a series of steps until they’re done. You can comment on cards and attach files.

### 6. Track Your Team’s Productivity with iDoneThis
This simple, yet genius, application sends everyone on your team a reminder email each evening. Each person replies to [iDoneThis](https://idonethis.com/) with what he or she accomplished that day. You receive a digest the next morning that helps you track work and celebrate wins.

### 7. Give Better Feedback With Skitch
If you need to comment on that presentation or new brochure, stop typing and download [Skitch](http://evernote.com/skitch/). This app allows you to snap a pic of whatever is on your computer screen then visually add feedback with arrows, notes, shapes and more.

### 8. Gather Inspiration With Private Pinterest Boards
[Pinterest](http://www.pinterest.com) isn’t just for shopping. Now that the site has introduced private boards, which you can share with a small group, it’s the perfect place to gather inspiration. Use it to bookmark articles, track ideas for your new website design or keep tabs on your competitor’s online efforts.

### 9. Talk Through Ideas With Discourse
This update on the old-school message board allows you to talk through ideas and issues with your team that are just too long for texts or instant messaging. [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/) is a place to have real private conversations when you don’t want to call a meeting.
