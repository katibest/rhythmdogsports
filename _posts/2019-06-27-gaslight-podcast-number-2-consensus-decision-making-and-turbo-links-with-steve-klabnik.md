To our delight, Steve Klabnik joins us on the second Gaslight podcast.  We learned about his passion for text-based adventure games at a young age and why "people problems" are more interesting than "technical problems" when developing software.  We also discuss how organizations can effectively use consensus discussion-making for a flatter structure. Finally Steve weighs in on the merits of Turbo Links and the need for measurable facts when talking performance.
