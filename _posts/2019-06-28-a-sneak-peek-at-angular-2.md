Angular 2 is 72% of the way to beta at last check. It's a great time to start seeing what's coming. In this video, I show off some of my favorite features of Angular 2 and talk about what the upgrade path from Angular 1 looks like. Hit play for an Angular 2 overview with code examples that cover:

* Making a component
* Template attribute syntax
* Dependency injection
* Observables
* Routing
* Upgrade Adapter
