We met with Sara Chipps and Erin Kidwell to talk about <a href="http://girldevelopit.com/">Girl Develop It</a>,
an organization that holds classes and events for developers and aspiring developers. In this episode we talk
about how Girl Develop It spread across the country with sold out classes in only 2 years. Also we discuss
creating an inclusive atmosphere and what makes a great teacher.
