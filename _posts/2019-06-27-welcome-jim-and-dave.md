# Jim Anders:

**What are you most looking forward to working at Gaslight?**
I am most looking forward to the change of pace from corporate product development, and the open, collaborative workspace.

**What's your favorite Cincinnati neighborhood?**
That I have lived and worked in Mason for the last 5 1/2 years means that I have spent most of my time there, but I have to say that downtown and the central business district have really grown on me. I'm a fan of tall buildings.

**What is your favorite meal?**
My mother's homemade meatloaf, mashed potatoes, and green beans.

**If you could have superpower, what would it be?**
Wolverine's regeneration power.



# Dave Starke:

**What are you most looking forward to working at Gaslight?**
Working with awesome and knowledgable people and absorbing as much of that knowledge as possible.

**What is your favorite meal?**
That would depend on if its eating out or cooking at home. As far as restaurants go, I would have to say anything Chinese.  For home cooking, the first thought would be stroganoff!

**If you could have any superpower, what would it be?**
Teleportation!

**If you could visit anywhere in the world, where would you go?**
This is a very hard question as there are many places of course, however touring Machu Picchu would be amazing!

>Please join us in welcoming these two, and as always, ask them anything in the comments!
