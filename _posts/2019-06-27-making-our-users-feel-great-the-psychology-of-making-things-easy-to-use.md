The design industry has lost focus on what it means to be a user experience designer. It's not about writing requirements, drawing wireframes, graphic design or even user research. It's about making your users feel great.

While those other skills are important, they are just a means to an end. A way to enable users to accomplish what they need to accomplish.

We conduct user interviews and usability testing to learn directly from our users, but our brains aren't wired to express how we feel. So, how can we learn from our user's feelings to make our products better?
