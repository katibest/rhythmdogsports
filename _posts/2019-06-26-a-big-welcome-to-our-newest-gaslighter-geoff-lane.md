### Where would you like to live?

If I could live anywhere in the US it would probably be Chicago. My wife and I met when we were both living there and we've always loved the city. Unfortunately jobs took us away and have conspired to keep us from living there. If it was anywhere in the world, I think it would be Amsterdam. I just love the feel of the whole city. It's a very human scale, with the little streets running next to the canals and the beautiful architecture of the row houses. It's a wonderful, walkable city with a great culture.

### What is the quality you most admire in a man?

I think I have two main qualities that I admire:

1. Is something along the lines of initiative or taking ownership of your own happiness. I admire when people recognize that they're not happy and do things to change their situation.

2. Empathy. I think the ability to take another person's perspective is so important. The ability to understand that not everyone has your beliefs, has your talents, or advantages in life is one of the things that allows someone to be a great human.

### What is the quality you most admire in a woman?

I hope not to have different qualities that I admire in someone based on their gender. These qualities are universal.

### What is it that you most dislike?

Cruelty and willful ignorance. 

### What do you value most in your friends?

I live pretty far away from some of by best friends. I think the thing that I value the most is just the friendship that we can have even when we only rarely see each other. When we can get together after not seeing each other for years and just pick up right where we left off it seems.
