At Gaslight, we're constantly improving. It was only 2.5 years ago that we changed from a cooperative of independent consultants to [a full-fledged software development company](http://gaslight.co/blog/with-purpose). Last year, we added a guide position to better serve our clients and [we also rebranded ourselves](http://gaslight.co/blog/how-i-sold-gaslight-on-our-new-brand).

We care so much about improving that we even [improved this blog you're reading](http://gaslight.co/blog/why-we-wrote-a-blog)!

Recently, we've improved our space. With [2 new hires](http://gaslight.co/blog/welcome-to-the-new-gaslighters), the space was getting a little cramped so we acquired the office next to our current one. Besides that, our new office manager, Merrilee, helped us improve our space with a fresh coat of paint and furniture.
