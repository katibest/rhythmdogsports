Gaslight has been the proud host of many a meetup over our decade in Cincinnati. We have started and/or hosted popular development groups like Cincy Js, Tech Cafeteria, and the Elixir Meetup. Now our designers are getting into the mix by hosting a quarterly Dribbble meetup.
 
# Never Heard of Dribbble?
Dribbble is a creative platform for sharing and inspiring a diverses range of design work. Millions have posted illustrations, print layout, and ux work that serves as a rich library of creative ideas. You can see the [Gaslight design team]’s work on it as well. It also happens to be basketball themed...cause, why not!

# Our First Shot
Our first time meeting up was February 20th this year. Our hope was to use the event as an opportunity to get to know and learn from other talented creatives in the Cincinnati region. With focusing on sharing work and learning from each other, we think it was a big success!

Several designers participated in our shot contest by submitting designs of famous [Cincinnati landmarks](https://dribbble.com/shots/5619079-Cincinnati-Dribbble-Meetup/rebounds). They were all great and prizes were awarded to the whole group. 

We also had a local art director, Joel Leineweber, share a short talk entitled CRAP (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity). He shared how these common design principles can be applied to many different disciplines. Better yet, there were many poop emojis involved.

To wrap up the night we all divide up into to teams for a fast paced design challenge. After pulling an everyday item out of a hat, each team spent 20 minutes come up with a redesigned version. One member of each team presented their revolutionary or a crazy idea to the whole group. The new shovel spoon was quite interesting.

We feel like our first Dribbble meetup was quite a success! That’s why we have already started planning the next one on Tuesday, June 11th. If you love Cincinnati and design, come join us. We can’t wait to meet you!
