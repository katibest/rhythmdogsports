Chris Nelson's been busy!

In early November, Chris gave a talk at Ruby Conf "[Machine learning for fun
and profit: the story of how my customer wrote my
code](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/1316-rubyconf2012-machine-learning-for-fun-and-profit-the-story-of-how-my-customer-wrote-my-code)". In it, Chris
delves into decision trees, when they are appropriate tools, and their
implementation in Ruby. In domains that implement overwhelming numbers of
conditional rules that can be expressed as tabular data, decision tree
algorithms can be utilized to determine outcomes instead of writing tons of
conditional logic.

In late November, Elizabeth Naramore interviewed Chris on the Engine Yard
Podcast, [Cloud Out Loud](http://www.engineyard.com/podcast/gaslight-qcmerge-mastering-backbone). Elizabeth and Chris talked about what we do at Gaslight
and his [Mastering Backbone](http://www.masteringbackbone.com/) training
class. They talk about Chris's latest open source project
[Backtastic](https://github.com/gaslight/backtastic), which aims to make
building forms in a Rails-backed Backbone app easier and more enjoyable. They
talk about how the [QCMerge](http://qcmerge.com/) conference, the [Web Tech
Drinkup](http://www.meetup.com/Cincinnati-Web-Tech-Drinkup/), and [Gaslight
Coffee](http://gaslight.co/coffee) have revitalized the developer community in
Cincinnati. Give it a listen if you're interested in hearing details about
what Chris has been working on, and the kinds of projects we've been working
on at Gaslight!

Keep up the good work Chris!
