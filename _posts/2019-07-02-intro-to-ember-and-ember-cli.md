Ember is a great tool once you know the basics. The infamous learning curve of the old days has improved drastically. Even then convention can be difficult when you don't know what the conventions are. This talk from [developer Jimmy Lauzau](https://twitter.com/jimmay5469) should help get you up and running. He covers:

* Getting started
* Components
+ Routes
+ Objects
+ Services
+ Models
+ Controllers
+ And more!
