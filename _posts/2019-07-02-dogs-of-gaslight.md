At Gaslight, we believe dogs are important to personal wellness, productivity, and are an overall [culture booster](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/danielle-hark/pet-ownership-health_b_3187960.html)! We believe in a strong work-life balance, and growing and working at a sustainable pace; what better way to slow ourselves down and reduce stress than spending time with our fuzzy friends! And we aren’t the only ones to discover this— there’s an [upward trend](https://s3.amazonaws.com/filecache.drivetheweb.com/mr5mr_purina/178202/PURINA-PETS+AT+WORK+REPORT.pdf) of bringing your lovable companions into the office.

## Rocket

Rocket is the office regular, and rightfully so! 
This Australian Cattle Dog loves keeping spirits high with frisbee and tug with his officemates! Rocket truly encompasses the “Work Hard Play Hard” mentality — in the morning he enjoys afternoon naps in the huddle rooms and belly rubs during standup!

## Lucy

 Our resident Vizsla is a perfect example of a good, old-fashioned companion dog! She enjoys the simple things in life: a nice, warm blanket to nest in, a rawhide to hoard, and a human to bask in the affection of. This sweet angel will capture your heart with her expressive eyes, smooth luxurious coat, soulful personality, and that adorable cheek-puffing-while-sniffing-thing. (You know the one!)

## Zoey

Zoey is a precious little princess Cavapoo who is, quite possibly, the most spoiled dog on the planet.
She loves being held at the dog park, instead of playing like a peasant dog! She enjoys sleeping on pillows, screeching like a banshee while she plays with her sister, Nora, and taking naps in her momma’s lap after lunch.
More than anything else, this little baby adores snuggles and being chauffeured in the arms of humans!

## Josie

This green-eyed beauty of a Goldendoodle loves to pal around with her best buddy Rocket!
Baby Josie is also an office regular, who enjoys wrestling matches, long petting sessions, and walks to the many parklets in Cincinnati with her puppy buddies! When she’s not romping around with her partner-in-play, this majestic, curl-covered teddy bear can be found lounging with her momma!

## Gus Gus

This Goldendoodle is as loveable as he is aloof! 
He is crazy for his ball-ball (but seriously, he goes nuts for that thing!) and loves anyone who will throw it for him!
Outside of his ball-ball induced craze, he is usually found lounging, soaking up the sun and savoring all the pets and snuggles he can get!

## Joy

This big ball of puppy energy is the newest addition to the Dogs of Gaslight crew! While she has outgrown most of the other dogs here, she has all the spunk and enthusiasm of any Golden Retriever puppy out there! While this fluffy puppy never ceases to have a smile on her face and spread happiness and joy throughout the office, she can also roughhouse and hoard toys with the best of them!
