We were excited to welcome Tara Manicsic, a director and founder of the [Cincinnati Women Who Code chapter](http://www.meetup.com/WWCode-Cincinnati/), to June's [Tech Cafeteria](http://tech-cafeteria.com/). She shined some light on how companies that want to diversify their dev teams can find women to hire. 

After speaking with contacts in different Women Who Code networks, she shared insight into some pitfalls of common strategies for recruiting women and opportunities to do better. She also gave us a look into what CincyWWC has planned for the local tech community in the next few months.  

Her talk covers:

- The current status of women in tech
- The obstacles facing women
- Recruiting women
- Keeping women in tech
