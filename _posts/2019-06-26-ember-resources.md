I've heard lots of good noises coming from the Ember camp lately, so I started
diving in a couple weeks ago. I'm really excited with what I've seen, but
getting started is still harder than it should be. The documentation is
improving rapidly, but it was still difficult to get over the initial hump.
We're super lucky to have [@workmanw](https://twitter.com/workmanw) here in
town. He's a Sproutcore veteran and Ember promoter who's also been really
helpful with questions we've had along the way. I also compiled this list of
what I found to be the most helpful.

### Tom's Talk at Seattle Ember

Tom covers [Ember Data](https://github.com/ember/data). Data is exciting
because it'll abstract away lots of work that gets duplicated on most
projects.
