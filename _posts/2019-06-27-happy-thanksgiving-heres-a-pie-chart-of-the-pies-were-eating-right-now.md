Thanksgiving is a time for sharing stories with friends and family, a time to stuff your face with all of the turkey and mashed potatoes imaginable and a time to just unwind and get a well deserved break from the daily grind. Here at Gaslight, it is about the pie … 

I went on a quest to find out just what kind of pie my fellow Gaslighters will be devouring on today. The results are in.

Pumpkin pie with whipped cream seems to be the top choice for many as Michelle, Bill, Lauren, James, Doug, Jim, Merrilee and Alex H. all claimed it as their pie of the holiday. Peter added, “Is there any pie other than pumpkin?” when describing his Thanksgiving dessert. 

Pecan pie and apple pie each tallied three votes in our office poll. Personally, I’ll be adding vanilla ice cream to my apple pie just to get that perfect mixture of cold and warm. 

Geoff Lane told me he’ll be eating cherry cream cheese pie once the turkey settles and added that it’s, “not to be confused with cherry cheesecake.” 

Some of the more unconventional answers I received included designer Kenny Glenn’s reply, “Cake pie, the double chocolate variety.” What he really meant is that his grandfather makes a double chocolate cake for him every year.  

Tim Mecklem said banana cream pie? I don’t know, I am just as confused as you on this one. 

Whatever pie you’re eating this Thanksgiving, we hope you are doing so with great joy. So from all of us here at Gaslight, HAPPY THANKSGIVING!
