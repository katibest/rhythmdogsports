This week we recorded the Podcast at Kevin's house with our past design intern and now newest full-time hire, Ryan Arthur. In this episode we talk about learning with digital doodles, Haml & Sass, responsive designs, the importance of user experience design over aesthetic design, and how to find a design job you'll love.
