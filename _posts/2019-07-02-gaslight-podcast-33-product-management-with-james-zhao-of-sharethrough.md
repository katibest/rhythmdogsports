Gaslight developer [Joel Turnbull](/people/joel-turnbull) and I chatted with James Zhao, Product Manager at Sharethrough, about what makes for great product management in the software world. Sharethrough is a native advertising company and [one of our clients](https://teamgaslight.com/work/sharethrough). 
James talked to us about:

* His philosophy for being a product manager
* Why empathy is crucial in product management
* Setting quarterly milestones
* The poker chip method of choosing features to build
* How product managers often act as janitors
* And what he's doing on a day-to-day basis
