When I turned 16, my first 'car' was a 1984 Chevy 1500 4x4. Shortly after
turning 16 I found my love for Formula 1 Racing and all things that go fast.
What I quickly realized was that my old farm truck would never be either of
those things.

In the physical world, we are able to quickly discern when things don't fit. Our
brains are trained in this regard at a very young age as we try to shove a
square block into a round hole. Why then, when it comes to programming
technologies can we not see when things just don't fit? Why do we allow
ourselves to suffer through using some new language or framework when it is
clearly painful?

As developers we are faced, almost daily, with the decision of which tech stack
we should use. And with new languages and frameworks being released constantly
this decision isn't getting any easier. We end up acting like raccoons falling
for a trap, chasing the shiny thing, never realizing that eventually this will
become painful. I have fallen for this, just as we all have, but how can we
mitigate the pain?

Trying a new library, framework or methodology is _not_ a bad thing, but try to
do it with minimal risk to your client or product. Start in a time box, set a
timer if you have to, and say "I am going to spike on this for 3 hours". For me
there is no greater shame than going to my client or product owner having wasted
hours or days trying something new that didn't work. If the spike fails, there
is not too much to recover from and still deliver the feature on time.

Recognizing the pain is probably the most difficult part of this for all of us.
At what point can we say the pain is too great and call our effort a loss? For
me, it is when I start saying things like, "I could have solved this easily in
technology X". Or when I open my editor and stare blankly like a deer caught in
the headlights. At this point stepping back and re-evaluating the decision to
use this new technology is key.

There should also exist a hard limit on the number of new things to try in a
project. Buzzword technologies are everywhere, and trying to munge them all
together in one project is sure to inflict the most pain. Taking the time to
evaluate the one that fits your project and use case, seems the most logical
approach.

Trying new things is vital to the survival of the programmer, if we didn't, we
might all still be using punch cards to write our programs. Trying new things
which harms my project, causes stress or pain, or introduces tension amongst my
team is the exact opposite of survival. Save the stress and pain for when your
child starts dating, and minimize it in your project today.
