I'm excited to announce I'll be speaking at [CocoaConf Columbus](http://cocoaconf.com/columbus-2013/home) next month. You should totally be there. I'll be talking about [CocoaPods](http://www.cocoapods.org), the awesome iOS dependency management tool. Here's the full abstract:

> Dependency Management is one of those things you just shouldn't have to worry about. Unfortunately, doing iOS and Mac development means you've probably spent a lot of time fighting Xcode when using third-party libraries. CocoaPods offers a better alternative. Pulling down code, resolving dependencies, and setting up your project workspace just got a lot easier. Sound too good to be true? Come find out how CocoaPods can make your life simpler.
