Concurrency is all the rage. When you have tons of data being shoved down your throat, you need all the help you can get. All the cool kids are turning to alternatives to try and keep up: node.js, clojure, erlang, elixir, Go. Popular thinking is that [Ruby](http://teamgaslight.com/blog/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=ruby) is too slow and wonâ€™t scale. But our favorite friend can support it very well. 

In my talk at the 2014 Burlington Ruby Conference, I took a look at the actor pattern in Ruby with Celluloid and compared it to similar solutions in other languages.
