Missed this month's [Tech Cafeteria](http://tech-cafeteria.com/)? No sweat, we captured it all on video. Dan Reynolds, co-founder of Brave Berlin, gave us an inside look at how Lumenocity comes together. Watch to find out how this amazing music, art and light show is born. He told us about reviewing music with the symphony, woking with artists and animators, creating stunning visual effects, and setting up an on-street control station to bring it all to life. Along with some insight on building a creative career.

[Tech Cafeteria](http://tech-cafeteria.com/) is the only Cincinnati tech event that pairs a real live lunch lady with inspiring tech talks. On the first Wednesday of each month, Ruby the lunch lady serves up trays of food inspired by grade school favorites. And a guess speaker gives you insight into a totally delicious tech topic. Tickets are free, but they usually go fast. [Sign up for our email list for first dibs on tickets.](http://info.teamgaslight.com/tech-cafeteria-email-list-sign-up)
