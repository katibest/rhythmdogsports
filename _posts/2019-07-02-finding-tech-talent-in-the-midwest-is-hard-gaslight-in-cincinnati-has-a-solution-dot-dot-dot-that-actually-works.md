How are we doing this? We recruit and train developers from all over the country to work at your company, on your product, with daily guidance from Gaslight mentors. After 6 months of working together, the decision to hire (or not) is all yours.

What makes the Apprenticeship Program different? If you outsource hiring to a recruiter or staff augmentation company, you may be wondering how a Gaslight apprentice stands out.



**Proven success:** We have a five-year track record of successfully growing young developers into attractive professional candidates.



**Untapped resource:** By investing in high-aptitude beginners, you can choose the best talent among brand new resources and partner in their growth.



**Chosen by industry experts:** We know the software development business and carefully evaluate a candidate’s capacity to excel in this field. Trained to adapt and delight: Apprentices learn by following Gaslight’s processes, which are agile, collaborative, and design-centered.



**Guaranteed right-fit:** The best hires have not just the right skills, but also fit into your company culture. With this program, you can fully vet both.



From startups to Fortune 500 companies, the program is a trusted resource, “Through the Apprenticeship program, we hired four developers. After working hand-in-hand with their Gaslight mentor for six months, they quickly became trusted team members and great full stack developers. The whole team enjoyed getting to bring people in and watch them learn and become the perfect fit for our team. It’s one of the best ways for us to create new talent for Kroger.” —Dominic Varacalli, Digital Development Manager at Kroger
