"Where do I fit in" This is my first thought as I walk into the door at
Gaslight. It's my first day, and just like so many other interns on their first
day or any person on their first day I was unsure but excited start a new
position, meet new people, learn new things, and show what I can do. Lucky for
me, Gaslight is filled with friendly, knowledgable, light-hearted people, and
the transition into the team was painless.

One of the qualities they possess that really stood out in this process was
their love of teamwork. They truly value the way true teamwork and the
relationships that accompany it can impact the flow of a company. Here everyone
is an equal and it really changes the way tasks and projects are accomplished
and the types of interactions between individuals in the office. My point is
that the importance of teamwork is what really eased my transition from a newbie
into a valued member of the Gaslight team.

In my first week, I had the privilege to attend the QCMerge. It was full of
learning opportunities and is a great way to network with people in the
technical and business communities. Two things in particular have stuck with me.
Firstly, Jessica Ivins gave a great presentation on how to identify with mystery
user groups when creating new products. The second is a quote from Doug Alcorn,
"You can't estimate software production time." I find both of these things
helpful and true, especially as time moves on.

Since my first week here, I've been given an awesome amount of learning
opportunities and support. It's a unique experience to fully choose your own
curriculum when completing an internship with a company, and it's very
liberating. It's exciting to not be bound by a job title, and have your teammates
encourage the learning that is taking place (not just in the office, but in the
community). Gaslight really takes it upon themselves to help foster learning and
sharing within the community and host a variety of events to encourage this.
It's really inspiring to see how involved and influential they can be to the
people and businesses around them.

The first month in this position has been an eye-opening experience. I'm excited
for the opportunities and knowledge that will come in the future, and consider
myself lucky to have landed here.
