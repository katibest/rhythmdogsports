We're really excited to launch a new video series called Ask Super Chris. In these short videos, Gaslight [co-founder Chris Nelson](https://teamgaslight.com/people/chris-nelson) answers tech questions big and small -- from how to support your daughter's interest in technology to dealing with imposter syndrome. 

The first three videos just went live, and you can hit play below on the first one: What is the history of JavaScript Frameworks? Then [subscribe to our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC36CM_uLqhoKEqSy2mjqFQ) to catch new ones as we release them.
