Let's stop comparing apples to oranges ... 


People often compare the cost of an apprenticeship program to the cost of hiring an outside recruiter - but we have to be honest with you, that makes no sense! A traditional recruiter will charge a fee to find a developer, and even then, what is the criteria they use? Even if this fee is high (say $25,000), it's often quite a bit less than the hourly cost for six months for a mentor and two apprentices. The problem with this comparison is that it does not account for the value delivered over those six months. 


Our apprenticeship model is about providing you with a team that produces both short-term and long-term value. In fact, this team can start delivering on your project within the first few weeks.
