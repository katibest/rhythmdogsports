Backbone.js has exploded in popularity in the past couple years. As one of the earlier shops to embrace it, we’ve learned a lot about how to use it more effectively over time. We’ll start with introducing backbone.js to catch everybody up that hasn’t used it, but spend most of this session digging in a little deeper to cover topics like composite views, model relationships, error response handling, memory management, just to name a few.
