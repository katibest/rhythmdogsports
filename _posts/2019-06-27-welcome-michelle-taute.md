### What do you consider the most overrated virtue? 

Following the rules.

### Which words or phrases do you most overuse?
Sadly, I say the word "like" way, way too often. When I'm excited, I'll yell out "kerpow" and do a fake ninja kick.

### What is your most treasured possession?
Probably the giant washer on my keychain that my dad, who is an industrial mechanic, gave me when I went to college. Fingers crossed that I don't jinx myself and lose it now. 

### What is your motto?

 Everything is invented.

### What do you consider your greatest achievement? 

No clue. Hopefully, it hasn't happened yet.
