### Component-Oriented: The Past and Future of Web Development
Swing a stick in a crowded room full of web
developers. You are almost guaranteed to hit
someone who has worked with an MVC
framework, and can probably name both a
client side and server side example. But
MVC, as it's typically defined, is not the only
game in town. Component oriented
frameworks have been giving developers a
more productive and enjoyable way to build
web apps for 10 years, and today the
approach is gaining serious attention on the
client side. Come see what component
oriented development looks like, how it lets
us work at a better level of abstraction and
gives us a better way for designers and
developers to work together. We'll also look
at how the component oriented paradigm is
finding new life on the client in both W3C
standards and the most popular client side
frameworks of right now.
