We’ve been in our new downtown office just over a month, and so far, we're loving the new space and location. For many of us, it’s a relief not to make the long commute to Blue Ash every day by car. Instead, we’re biking, walking, busing and more.
 
In fact, we polled everyone in the office to find out exactly how we’re getting to 708 Walnut. (Percentages add up to more than 100 because many of us alternate between two or more transportation methods.)

The only tiny downside to our new office? It’s sometimes a challenge for new visitors to find parking or just figure out the best way to get here. With that in mind, we compiled a definitive guide to visiting the new Gaslight office to make your visit as easy as possible.

##The Office
We’re at 708 Walnut Street in downtown Cincinnati. For natives, we’re on the same block as Jeff Ruby’s Steakhouse. There are two doors at street level labeled 708, but you want the one to the right of Gallery 708, the art gallery on the first floor of our building. You should walk into a small room with an elevator to your right. There will be a sign to the right of the elevator that has a label for Gaslight, LLC. Walk right in and take the elevator up to the fifth floor. 
 
## Where to Park
There are a number of parking options within a short walk to our office. Our favorite spots from closest to farthest away:

### A Note on Special Events
If there’s a special event downtown, such as a ballgame or Aronoff performance, most lots and garages charge a higher rate, typically $10 or more.
 
## Taking the Bus
As you can tell from the infographic above, we’re big fans of riding the bus. The closest stop to our office is at Walnut and 8th (right in front of the library), but there are many other bus stops within a short walk.
 
Check the [Metro site for the most current routes and schedules.]( http://www.go-metro.com/) If you’ve never rode Metro before, they have a great [how to ride Metro guide](http://www.go-metro.com/riding-metro) online to answer all your questions.
 
We’re also experimenting with a real-time bus app at [busdetective.com]( http://busdetective.com/), so you’ll know exactly when your bus is coming.
 
## Biking Options
### Your Bike
If you’re a cyclist, we have bike parking in our office. You can bring your bike right up the elevator.
 
### Cincy Red Bike
You’ll find two Cincy Red Bike stations steps from our office, one at 7th and Walnut (Aronoff Center) and another at Vine and 8th (Public Library). Some of us [park underneath Washington Park](http://washingtonpark.org/parking/) then take a Red Bike to the office. Here’s a [full list of Red Bike stations.](http://www.cincyredbike.org/locations/)
 
### Cincinnati Streetcar
There’s a Cincinnati Streetcar stop right across the street from our office. We hear the first rides will start in September 2016, and we can’t wait!
 
If you haven’t been to our new office yet, we’d love it if you would stop by any Friday morning from 8 to 10 a.m. for [Gaslight Coffee.](https://teamgaslight.com/coffee)
