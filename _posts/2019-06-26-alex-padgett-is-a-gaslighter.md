### When and where were you happiest?

Hard to pinpoint an exact moment.  I don’t think I realized it at the moment, but honestly high school was probably the happiest time of my life. 

### Which talent would you most like to have?

Of the talents I currently think I lack, I’d like to be able to actually understand and create my own music instead of just learning songs that other people already wrote. 

### If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?

I wish I didn’t have to work so hard to motivate myself to do things.  I’d like to be able to just naturally be driven instead of needing something like Adderall to get me through the day, or having to continually talk myself into doing something before I just do it. 

### What do you consider your greatest achievement?

So far, college.  And honestly working my way up to Gaslight.  I’ve always viewed Gaslight as “the experts”, so getting this job was a big milestone for me in my career and was somewhat of a way of validating my skill set to myself

### If you were to die and come back as a person or a thing, what would it be?

I’m not sure I’d want anything that different.  If I had to choose, I’d probably just want to be someone like Elon Musk.

### Where would you most like to live?

I like Cincinnati, most of my family is here.  If I could get everyone to pick up and move somewhere it would either be Chicago or San Francisco.
