Lots of good stuff happening soon. Let's jump right in!

## CincyNg

AngularJS seems to be taking the world by storm. Mike Ball has organized an AngularJS
group here in town and he's calling it [CincyNg][cincyng]. We're hosting the first one
next Tuesday, so come by and check it out!

* When: Tuesday, July 30 at 12:00pm
* Where: [Gaslight][gaslightmap]

## Bold Fusion

This is [HYPECincinnati][hype]'s big annual event. We're super excited to be a sponsor.
We'll be using [Twallaby][twallaby] on the big screens, so come check it out! I'll be
live tweeting the event, too.

[Carin Meier][carin]. It's sold out, but keep an eye out. I'm sure there will be more.

* When: September 7th
* Where: Mason Tech Center

## Southwest Ohio Give Camp

We've participated in every SWOGC to date and we have no plans to stop. It's a great event
and a chance to give back. Work with local non-profits to get a web presence, help setup
email and even some light application development.

They always need design help, too.

Did I mention there's lots of great food? See you there!

* When: October 18&ndash;20
* Where: Miami University Voice of America Learning Center
* [More info and registration][swogc]
