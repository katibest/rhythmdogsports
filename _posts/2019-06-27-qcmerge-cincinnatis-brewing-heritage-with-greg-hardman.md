Greg talks about the revitalization of Cincinnati's brewing heritage and how his Christian Moerlein Brewing Company has taken a leadership position in bringing back a city's brewing culture. He will explore the Brewery District's strategic master plan and how it will create a new energy for the city and be an economic driver through heritage tourism.
