## Azure Mobile Services

Ease your mobile app development to the cloud powered by Javascript with
Azure Mobile Services.

Javascript, it’s not just for browsers anymore. If you are a Javascript
developer today you are no longer confined to the browser frame, you can
take those skills to mobile devices, servers and the cloud. The technology
makes it possible, but it’s not easy. You’ve got a lot of learning to do
and a lot of things to worry about like data, identity, validation, push,
scale and diagnostics to name a few. Azure Mobile Services is there to make
it easy. It provides you a ton of backend services out of the box to help
you cloud enable those client apps utilizing the client side Javascript
skills you already have. If you are a node developer you can go even
further. It doesn’t stop there though, it includes client SDKs for IOS,
Android, WIndows 8 and a newly announced library for Phonegap/HTML5 which
you can use to reach any device anywhere. You have to just see it to believe
it, and if you come to this talk you will!
