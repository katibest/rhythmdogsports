A big welcome to the newest Gaslighter, Kenny Glenn!

![Kenny Glenn](https://gaslight-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/kenny-glenn-is-a-gaslighter/kenny.jpg)

### What is your idea of perfect happiness?

A lazy Sunday.

### What is your greatest fear?

Completely losing touch with reality.

### What is the trait you most deplore in yourself?

Passiveness.

### What is the trait you most deplore in others?

I can't say I have ever had an interesting conversation with a person who isn't passionate about something.

### Which living person do you most admire?

I admire Michael Jordan because he was passionate about competition. MJ was someone I looked up to as a kid and as an adult I can really see why. He had the drive to win and he did it all with his tongue out.
