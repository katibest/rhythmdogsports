At Gaslight, we're always trying to better ourselves and learn more about what we love. Here are some of the smartest things we've read about design, development and business lately. Oh, and a few of our very favorite cat gifs.

### Great Long Reads 

The whole company reads a book together each month, and right now we're reading [The Five Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick Lencioni](http://www.amazon.com/The-Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership/dp/0787960756/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1411068842&sr=8-1&keywords=the+five+dysfunctions+of+team), a leadership fable that reveals the five pain points for teams and why even the best ones struggle.

Last month we read [Getting Naked by Patrick Lencioni](http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Naked-Business-Shedding-Sabotage/dp/0787976393). It sheds light on the fears that prevent healthy client relationships and gives a road map for deeper, more honest partnerships.

These next two aren't official book club selections, but some of us are reading:
[Restful Web APIs by Leonard Richardson](http://www.amazon.com/RESTful-Web-APIs-Leonard-Richardson/dp/1449358063), which shows you how to design reusable REST APIs.

[The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win by Gene Kim](http://www.amazon.com/The-Phoenix-Project-Helping-Business/dp/0988262592), a business fable about an IT manager who has 90 days to rescue an IT initiative. It outlines the Three Ways he uses to accomplish it.
