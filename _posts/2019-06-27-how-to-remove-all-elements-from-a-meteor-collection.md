Meteor collections have a `remove()` method. For example, on a `Post` collection, you can call



```javascript

Post.remove("3WRHexCGhZdSa3H9L") // remove a post with that mongo '_id'

Post.remove({title:"How to Blog"}) // remove a post with that title

Post.remove({}) // remove every post

```



The catch is that you're not allowed to call `Post.remove({})` from the console. You'll see



```javascript

Error: Not permitted. Untrusted code may only remove documents by ID. [403]

```



You're also not allowed to call `remove({})` from any client side code. If your app accumulates a bunch of crufty data while you're prototyping, you might be sad about this. Client side code and the console fall under the concept "Untrusted Code" introduced by Meteor in 0.5.8.



> Starting in 0.5.8, client-only code such as event handlers may only update or remove a single document at a time, specified by _id." [Moreâ€¦]("http://www.meteor.com/blog/2013/03/13/meteor-058-security-fix-appcache-db-transforms-new-deps")



"Trusted Code" includes the server code and method code. The key to the solution is that you can call methods defined on the Meteor server from the client using the `Meteor.call` method. Therefore, this will work in the console



```javascript

Meteor.call('removeAllPosts')

```



Assuming you define `removeAllPosts` on the server like so



```javascript

if (Meteor.isServer) {

  Meteor.startup(function() {

    return Meteor.methods({

      removeAllPosts: function() {

        return Posts.remove({});

      }

    });

  });

}

```
