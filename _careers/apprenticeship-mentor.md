<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>Apprentice mentors are experienced developers with a purpose: welcoming people into the field of software development. As a mentor, you will continue to use your experience and skills to write code and ship features. You’ll do so alongside enthusiastic, high aptitude beginning developers and help to quite literally change their lives. You’ll get to be involved in the interview and selection process for apprentices. As one of the first mentors, you’ll get to shape and grow the program with us. We are committed to making this the best possible way to build developers and we expect to continue to learn from our apprentices how to keep getting better at it.</p>
