<p><b>Reports to: Design Manager</b></p>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>Designers at Gaslight are talented artists and hands-on coders. Designers play a significant role in creating the look and feel of our clients’ web apps. They make things fun and easy to use while keeping productivity in mind. Designers work closely with developers, collaborating on code.</p>
<p>Designers are involved in the big picture planning of client projects. Gaslight designers have the power to push for new ideas and help clients understand the value of the work we’re delivering. They’re given great autonomy. Our designers work on small teams, typically with two developers and the client.</p>
<p>We're not actively hiring designers at the moment, but we're always up for meeting new people — stop by our Friday Coffee Hour and let's chat!</p>
