Haley loves supporting the local design community almost as much as she loves being a designer. She’s co-president of the Cincinnati AIGA chapter and passionate about creating a supportive environment for local designers. Her favorite part? Connecting talented individuals looking to land their first job out in the real world. She believes it’s important to give them a step ahead with a little insight and honesty.   

At Gaslight she creates amazing user experiences for client products, handling everything from high-level creative direction to user testing and building out concepts in HTML and CSS. Previously, Haley was Creative Lead for GNGF, a local agency that specializes in marketing and branding for law firms. There she managed a group of designers working on everything from websites to full-scale branding projects.   

Haley’s led or contributed to design projects that have racked up a number of awards, including a Silver Addy from the AAF of Cincinnati, and awards for identity design, web design and editorial design in the American Graphic Design Awards by GDUSA. She holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Graphic Design with a minor in marketing from Miami University (Love and Honor!) in Oxford, Ohio.   

If she’s not at work, you might find Haley chasing around her toddler or on the water fishing with her husband. She loves cooking and spending time with her family outdoors, and she’s a pretty mean whistler.
