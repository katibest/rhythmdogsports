Originally going to college to major in photography, Beau shifted his focus towards a career in design. He spent several years working at a large church overseeing all the graphic design and video production. After a couple of web related projects, Beau’s interest in web design began to grow until he eventually finished his bachelor's degree in Web/Interactive Media from Art Institute of Pittsburgh Online.

Beau spent seven years as the Media Director at the University of West Florida’s Institute for Innovative Community Learning. While at UWF he worked on projects utilizing all types of technology including ColdFusion, .NET, Wordpress and Flash. In 2015, Beau and his family moved to the Northern Kentucky area to work at Answers in Genesis. It was his first experience working on agile projects and with a full development/design team. As the lead web designer at AiG, he built a design system for their attraction’s websites, designed a VBS management software, and worked on many other projects.

Now serving as a UX Designer here at Gaslight, Beau enjoys working on solutions to complex user problems. He has a passion for UX Research and refining a design through the entire process. Beau loves being part of Gaslight, learning from the other designers and developers around him.

Along with his wife, Sunne and six children Beau enjoys hiking, camping, traveling, and just spending time together. You can also find him playing bass on his church’s worship band or watching a Cubs baseball game with one of his sons.
