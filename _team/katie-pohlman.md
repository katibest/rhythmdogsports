Katie headed to college with a trio of career possibilities in her head: teacher, physical therapist or designer. She settled on the latter because it allowed her to engage both the left and right sides of her brain on a daily basis.

At Gaslight, she loves to combine pragmatic problem solving with creativity as she designs digital products for clients large and small. You might find her sketching out user flows, creating style guides or building out screens in HTML and CSS. No matter the task, she’s constantly asking herself: Will this make sense to the user?

Previously, Katie worked as a graphic designer at Sanger & Eby, a Cincinnati design and technology agency. There she contributed to creative projects spanning from websites to annual reports for Macy’s, Fifth Third, St. Charles Community College and others. She holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Graphic Design from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.

Katie lives in Newport with her husband. In her spare time, she likes lifting free weights, baking sweets, and binge watching Hulu and Netflix.
