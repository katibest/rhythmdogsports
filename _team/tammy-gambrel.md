Tammy has loved art since she was a young girl. Her mom worked at an art museum in Oxford, Ohio, when she was growing up, and Tammy thought the museum was one of the most enchanting places on Earth.   

Today she brings her creativity and artistic eye to her work as the Operations Manager at Gaslight. She ensures things run smoothly around the office with her uncanny ability to see further down the road than others and her talent for keeping things grounded in reality.

Tammy studied art history and painting at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, and went on to work at many of Cincinnati’s major arts organizations. She started out in finance at the Cincinnati Art Museum and later became the Director of Development and Donor Relations at the Contemporary Arts Center and the Director of Special Events for the Cincinnati Ballet.   

She also founded a local art gallery with her sister, and her paintings have appeared in numerous shows. When she’s not at work, you might find Tammy at home in with her two dachshunds, Astrid and Obadiah, or on a local bike trail. She’s obsessed with tattoos, R.E.M. and Robert Downey, Jr.
