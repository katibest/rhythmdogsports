As a UX designer at Gaslight, Lauren is primarily responsible for building out screens in HTML and CSS. But she’s also on the hook for sketching user flows and creating style guides.

Always interested in the arts—mainly animation—she had several teachers and professors steer her toward a bachelors in visual communication design. She loves how design is not just beautiful, but it also make people's lives easier, sometimes without them even realizing it.

Previously, as the Art Director at 84.51°, Lauren planned and directed photo shoots and designed DM, emails, and microsite/websites for Kroger's Best-Customers. Through it all, she spent a lot of time looking at food!

The most important part of Lauren’s life, however, is her family: her husband, Jimmy, daughter, Abby, and baby on the way. Lauren can often be found working in the yard, going for hikes at various parks and nature centers, or riding bikes. That’s when she’s not watching Ohio State Football games or working toward her goal of visiting all 59 National Parks.
