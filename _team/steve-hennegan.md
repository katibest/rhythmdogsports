As the Director of Sales, Steve is responsible for revenue generation, new business acquisition, and internal process implementation at Gaslight. His genuine love for sales was often displayed in his previous roles as a national sales executive in the enterprise software space (previously at Xpertdoc Technologies and Sovos Compliance), and he is constantly looking for new and better ways to create value for prospects and clients throughout the sales process.

Steve has a passion for helping individuals and companies develop solutions for complex challenges and is energized by connecting people who can benefit mutually from an introduction.

His favorite individuals, however, are his wife Ashley and two daughters, Kiley (11) and Addison (6). They live in Lebanon, Ohio, with their dogs Otis and Django.
