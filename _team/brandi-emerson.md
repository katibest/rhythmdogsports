<p>Brandi has a passion for all things health and fitness. In her spare time you can find her teaching indoor cycling or bootcamp at least four times a week in local Cincinnati boutique fitness studios. Beginning in college, she found that taking care of herself, both mentally and physically, was the number one way to be successful in her studies, work, and social life.</p>

<p>Today she brings an interpersonal and creative take to her work as the Marketing Manager at Gaslight. She ensures that sincere relationships are built among the community, and that Gaslight is continuously working to be the hub for custom software in the city.</p>

<p>Brandi studied communication, public relations and electronic media at the University of Cincinnati in Cincinnati, Ohio, and went on to work for a company that curates boutique fitness brands. She started out with CycleBar Franchising LLC, traveling and opening studios across the US as an operations specialist.</p>

<p>She also loves to cook and explore places like OTR to support local small businesses, or travel to some of her favorite places like the Amalfi Coast, Nashville or Colorado. When she’s not at work you might find Brandi at home in the Mount Lookout/ Hyde Park area catching up with friends over a charcuterie board. She’s obsessed with a great tote bag, Nation Kitchen, and Ayesha Curry.</p>
