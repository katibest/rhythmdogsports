Software development is a second career for Bill Barnett. After serving in the Marine Corps and Air Force Reserve, he spent 17 years at Delta Air Lines. Bill worked as a baggage handler, cabin service agent, and supply attendant, but spent the bulk of his time at Delta as an aircraft mechanic.

While playing hockey, Bill broke his collarbone and spent time working behind a desk at Delta. He took that opportunity to create a software database application to track the location of tools and parts. The company loved the app but gave the app to another, more qualified employee to maintain.

It was then that Bill realized he would benefit from more education and enrolled in the University of Cincinnati, earning a bachelor’s degree in computer science while working full-time at Delta. He went on to work as a developer at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital and later SCRIP-SAFE, a company that created the country’s first electronic transcription system for high schools, colleges, and universities.

He co-founded Gaslight in 2009 because he saw an opportunity to serve the business community with agile software development. Today you’ll find him building web apps with Ruby and JavaScript. He has additional entrepreneurial experience with Cincinnati Coworks and BudgetSketch, and helped establish Southwest Ohio GiveCamp.

Bill lives in Anderson Township with wife Tammy and his daughter, Polly. He is a USA Hockey certified coach and enjoys riding bikes with Tammy. They're currently planning a trans-Ohio ride and one day hope to ride their bikes across the United States.
