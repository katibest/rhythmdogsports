If you happen to see someone walking by with two pups next to her, it's probably our designer Kati Best.

Before joining our design team, Kati worked at Western & Southern on many aspects of their digital world: banner ads, emails, and motion graphics. She loves how web design allows her to make something beautiful and user friendly, while also flexing her left brain with HTML and CSS . It was this balance that led her to major in Visual Communications at Northern Kentucky University.

If Kati's not in the office, she's probably rocking out to a Screamo band in the 134 year old house she shares with her dog, Rocket and her cat, Finn.
