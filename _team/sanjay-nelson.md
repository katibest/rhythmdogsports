Sanjay has been interested in technology for as long as he can remember. In his early teens, he absorbed himself with visual design, as well as audio and video production. After working several jobs producing audio, video, and graphic content for different businesses and organizations, Sanjay chose to pursue a career in software development. He spent months self-teaching with help from online resources and other developers in his family, and then went on to attend DevBootcamp. After completing the bootcamp, he went through the DevBuilders apprenticeship program, and has now come on as a Developer at Gaslight.

In his time outside of work, Sanjay can be found making music, spending time with friends about the city, going to concerts and festivals, or at home with a good book or record. Other than that, you can expect to see him at your local coffee shop.

In addition to working with his teammates here at Gaslight, Sanjay is excited to further himself as a developer by building projects, deepening his understanding of core concepts, and learning new languages and frameworks.
