A native of Cincinnati, Scott studied Industrial Design at the University of Cincinnati College of Design, Architecture, Art and Planning (DAAP) where he honed his skills for critical thinking and creative problem solving.   

Before joining Gaslight, Scott produced and managed much of the design work and technology decisions at a local non-profit. He can also claim to be one of Gaslightâ€™s first customers after hiring them to collaborate on building an online site to manage class registrations and provide a portal for over 1000 volunteer teachers. The agile process used during the project engagement and future projects continues to prove essential in continually providing value.   

Scott is a servant leader at heart. Though he manages a team of developers every day, he knows the value of listening to each one of them and making development a collaborative process. He is here to serve the developers and the clients for whom they build software.   

Scott resides in Western Hills with his wife Caroline whom he met at DAAP. They now have five children and you will often find them making art together as a family in just about any medium. He loves rock climbing (really any kind of climbing) and has been a certified climbing instructor for the Boy Scouts of America for many years.
